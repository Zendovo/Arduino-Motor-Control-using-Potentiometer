# Arduino-Motor-Control-using-Potentiometer
A basic Arduino Circuit and Code Setup containing A Servo motor along with a Potentiometer. The aim is to control the position of the motor according to the Value of potentiometer.

## Circuit Design :

## Description of Pins and Connections :

1. Pin 9 (PWM) : Used to send Signal Pin to Servo.
2. A1 (Analog Pin) : Used as Input pin for the Value of Potentiometer
3. The Code Maps the Value of Potentiometer ( 0 to 1023 ) to the Value acceptable by Motor ( 0 to 180 ). There are two commands so that the motor returns to original position before the next iteration.
